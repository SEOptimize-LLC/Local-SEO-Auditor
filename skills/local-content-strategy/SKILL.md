# Phase 12: Local Content Strategy

> **Content is the fuel for every local ranking signal.** On-Page signals (33% Organic, 24% AI Search, 15% Map Pack) are built on content. Links (24% Organic) are attracted by content. Reviews (20% Map Pack) are earned through the service experience that content helps sell. AI search citations (emerging) are generated from content that AI engines can extract and recommend. This skill builds a strategic content plan that serves all three channels simultaneously.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- **As part of the full Local SEO Audit**: Run as Phase 12, the final phase of the audit. All previous phases inform the content strategy — keyword research provides targets, on-page audit reveals gaps, link audit identifies linkable asset needs, and competitor analysis shows content opportunities.
- **As a standalone engagement**: When a client needs a content plan independent of a full audit, when organic traffic has plateaued, or when the client wants to build topical authority in their market.
- **Trigger scenarios**:
  - Client has a thin website with minimal content beyond basic service pages
  - Competitors are outranking with superior content depth and breadth
  - Client wants to rank for long-tail local queries that existing pages do not target
  - AI search engines are citing competitors but not the client
  - Client asks "what should we be writing about?"
  - Seasonal demand shifts require content preparation 60-90 days ahead
  - New service area expansion needs supporting content

---

## Channel Impact

| Channel        | Weight  | Rationale |
|----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Map Pack**   | **On-Page 15%** | GBP links to the website, and the quality of that destination page matters. Service pages with depth and local relevance reinforce GBP signals. Blog content supports topical authority. |
| **Organic**    | **On-Page 33%** | Content IS the on-page signal. Deep, locally-specific content that demonstrates E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is the primary organic ranking factor. |
| **AI Search**  | **On-Page 24% + Social 18%** | AI engines need content to cite. Unique local data, comprehensive guides, and authoritative resource pages are what AI engines extract when answering local queries. Social content amplifies reach. |

**Strategic reality**: Content is the only signal you fully control. You cannot control Google's algorithm, you cannot force reviews, and you cannot make other sites link to you. But you CAN create content that earns all of these things over time.

---

## Prerequisites

Before building the content strategy, ensure you have:

1. **Discovery Brief from Phase 1** (`/discovery-intake`)
   - Business type, services, service area
   - Target keywords (primary and secondary)
   - Competitor list

2. **Keyword Research from Phase 3** (`/local-keyword-research`)
   - Full keyword map with search volume, difficulty, and intent
   - Keyword clusters by topic
   - Long-tail local queries

3. **On-Page Audit from Phase 5** (`/local-on-page-audit`)
   - Current content inventory
   - Content quality assessment per page
   - Thin or missing content flags

4. **Link Audit from Phase 11** (`/local-link-audit`)
   - Linkable asset needs
   - "Best of" article gaps
   - Content types that attract links in this market

5. **User Data** (requested from client)
   - Google Search Console page performance data
   - Google Analytics landing page data (traffic, engagement, conversions)
   - Existing content calendar or editorial plan (if any)
   - Subject matter expertise available (who can review/contribute?)

---

## Assessment Framework

### 12.1 Local Topical Authority Assessment (20 points)

**Why This Matters**: Topical authority is Google's measure of how comprehensively a website covers a subject. A plumbing company with 3 service pages and no blog has LOW topical authority. A plumbing company with 15 deep service pages, 30 educational blog posts, and 5 area guides has HIGH topical authority. Google rewards depth and breadth within a topic cluster.

#### Assessment Criteria

| Signal | What to Evaluate | Strong Example |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Topic Coverage** | Does the site cover all major subtopics within its service area? | A dentist site with pages for cleanings, fillings, crowns, implants, whitening, pediatric, emergency, cosmetic, AND blog posts explaining each procedure |
| **Content Depth** | Are individual pages substantive (500+ words) with real expertise? | A service page with 800-1500 words covering process, pricing, FAQs, case studies — not 150 words of boilerplate |
| **Local Specificity** | Does content reference the specific service area with genuine local knowledge? | "Dallas homeowners with pier-and-beam foundations are especially prone to slab leaks due to the North Texas clay soil" vs. "homeowners may experience plumbing issues" |
| **Freshness** | Is content updated regularly with new posts and page refreshes? | Blog posts published 2-4x per month, service pages updated at least annually |
| **E-E-A-T Signals** | Does content demonstrate real experience and expertise? | Author bios with credentials, before/after project photos, specific case studies with outcomes |

#### Audit Steps

1. Count total indexable content pages on the site
2. Categorize pages by type (service, location, blog, about, other)
3. Assess average content depth (word count) across page types
4. Check content freshness (date of most recent blog post, last service page update)
5. Evaluate local specificity — does content mention specific cities, neighborhoods, local conditions?
6. Look for E-E-A-T signals: author bios, credentials, case studies, original photos
7. Compare content depth and breadth against top 3 competitors

**Scoring**:
- 0 points: Fewer than 10 content pages, no blog, thin service pages (<300 words average)
- 5 points: 10-20 content pages with some depth, occasional blog posts, limited local specificity
- 10 points: 20-40 content pages, regular blog (1-2x/month), moderate depth and local specificity
- 15 points: 40-75 content pages, consistent blog (2-4x/month), strong depth, local knowledge evident
- 20 points: 75+ content pages covering all service subtopics, active blog, deep local expertise, strong E-E-A-T

---

### 12.2 Content Types for Local Businesses (25 points)

Each content type serves specific channels and conversion goals. A complete local content strategy includes all seven types in appropriate proportions.

#### Type 1: Service Pages (Deep, Locally-Specific)

**Purpose**: Primary conversion pages. These are the pages that target "[service] in [city]" queries.

**Requirements**:
- 800-1500 words of unique, locally-specific content per service page
- City/area mentioned naturally 3-5 times
- Process explanation (what the customer can expect)
- Pricing transparency (ranges or starting prices)
- FAQ section with local questions (feeds FAQPage schema)
- Before/after examples from local projects
- Clear CTAs (call, form, schedule)
- Unique content per service — NO template pages with only the city name swapped

**Content Brief Template**:
```
SERVICE PAGE BRIEF
------------------
Target Keyword: [primary keyword + city]
Secondary Keywords: [3-5 related terms]
Word Count Target: 800-1500
Page URL: /services/[service-name]/

Outline:
  H1: [Service Name] in [City], [State]
  H2: Why [City] Homeowners Need [Service]
       - Local-specific reasons (climate, soil, building codes, etc.)
  H2: Our [Service] Process
       - Step-by-step explanation
       - What the customer can expect
  H2: [Service] Pricing in [City]
       - Price ranges with factors that affect cost
       - Financing options if available
  H2: [Before/After] Case Study
       - Real local project with photos
       - Problem, solution, outcome
  H2: Frequently Asked Questions
       - 3-5 local questions with detailed answers
  CTA: Schedule Your [Service] — Call [Phone] or Request a Quote

Schema: Service, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList
Internal Links: Related services, location page, blog posts on topic
```

**Scoring**: 0-5 points based on coverage and quality of service pages

---

#### Type 2: Location/Area Guides (Neighborhood Expertise)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate local expertise and target "[city]" and "[neighborhood]" queries. These pages build geographic relevance.

**Content Brief Template**:
```
AREA GUIDE BRIEF
------------------
Target Area: [City/Neighborhood Name]
Target Keywords: [service] [area], [area] [service], [service] near [area]
Word Count Target: 1000-2000

Outline:
  H1: [Service Category] Services in [Area Name]
  H2: About [Area Name]
       - Brief area description showing genuine local knowledge
       - Common property types, building ages, neighborhood characteristics
  H2: Common [Service] Issues in [Area Name]
       - Area-specific problems (e.g., "older homes in Lakewood have
         galvanized pipes that are prone to corrosion")
  H2: Our Experience in [Area Name]
       - X years serving this area
       - Number of projects completed
       - Notable projects or partnerships
  H2: [Area Name] [Service] Regulations
       - Local codes, permit requirements, utility specifics
  H2: What [Area Name] Residents Say
       - Testimonials from customers in this specific area
  H2: Service Coverage in [Area Name]
       - Response times, availability, service boundaries

Schema: LocalBusiness (with areaServed), FAQPage, BreadcrumbList
Internal Links: Service pages, other area guides, blog posts about area
```

**Scoring**: 0-5 points based on coverage of service areas

---

#### Type 3: Educational Blog Posts (Answer Local Questions)

**Purpose**: Capture long-tail informational queries, build topical authority, and create linkable assets. Blog content targets the "top of funnel" where people have questions but haven't chosen a provider yet.

**Content Types to Rotate**:
- How-to guides: "How to Prevent Frozen Pipes in Dallas Winters"
- Cost guides: "How Much Does AC Repair Cost in Houston in 2025?"
- Comparison guides: "Tankless vs. Traditional Water Heaters for North Texas Homes"
- Seasonal guides: "Fall HVAC Maintenance Checklist for Phoenix Homeowners"
- Problem-solution: "Why Your Water Bill Is High in [City] — 7 Common Causes"
- Regulation guides: "Understanding [City] Building Code Requirements for [Service]"

**Publishing Frequency Target**: 2-4 posts per month

**Scoring**: 0-5 points based on blog presence, frequency, and quality

---

#### Type 4: Seasonal Content (Aligned with Service Demand)

**Purpose**: Capture seasonally trending queries 60-90 days before peak demand. This is proactive content — it must be published BEFORE the season to have time to index and rank.

**Seasonal Content Calendar Framework**:

| Season | Home Services | Medical/Dental | Legal | Restaurant |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-------|------------|
| **Spring** | AC tune-up, allergy-proofing, spring plumbing check | Allergy season, spring check-ups | Tax-related legal issues | Patio season, Mother's Day |
| **Summer** | AC repair, pool maintenance, pest control | Back-to-school physicals, sports injuries | Summer custody issues | Summer menu, outdoor dining |
| **Fall** | Heating tune-up, gutter cleaning, winterization | Flu shots, open enrollment dental | Year-end estate planning | Football season, holiday catering |
| **Winter** | Frozen pipes, heating repair, emergency service | Holiday dental emergencies | New year estate planning, DUI | Holiday parties, New Year's Eve |

**Key Rule**: Publish seasonal content 60-90 days before the season begins. "How to Prevent Frozen Pipes in Dallas" should be published in October, NOT January.

**Scoring**: 0-3 points based on seasonal content presence and timing

---

#### Type 5: Community Content (Local Events, News, Sponsorships)

**Purpose**: Build local relevance and earn natural backlinks. Community content signals to Google that this business is an active part of the local community.

**Content Ideas**:
- "ABC Plumbing Sponsors the Dallas Youth Soccer League"
- "Our Team at the Fort Worth Community Clean-Up Day"
- "Local Business Spotlight: [Partner Business Name]"
- "Guide to [City] Summer Events 2025"
- "Supporting [Local Charity]: Our Annual Toy Drive Results"

**Link Benefit**: Community content earns links from the organizations, events, and partners mentioned. A blog post about sponsoring a youth soccer league often gets linked from the league's website.

**Scoring**: 0-3 points based on community content presence

---

#### Type 6: FAQ Content (What Locals Ask)

**Purpose**: Capture featured snippet positions and voice search results. FAQ content directly targets questions that local customers type into Google.

**Sources for FAQ Topics**:
1. Google's "People Also Ask" boxes for target keywords
2. Google Search Console — Queries report (what are people searching to find the site?)
3. Client's actual customer service call logs — what do callers ask?
4. GBP Q&A section — what are people asking there?
5. Reddit and community forums — what questions come up about this service in this city?
6. Review content — what concerns do reviewers mention?

**Scoring**: 0-3 points based on FAQ content depth and local specificity

---

#### Type 7: Case Studies (Local Projects, Before/After)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate real experience (the first "E" in E-E-A-T). Case studies are the strongest trust signal in content because they prove the business has actually done the work.

**Case Study Template**:
```
CASE STUDY BRIEF
------------------
Project: [Brief description]

- 20 points: Service pages + blog + 4-5 additional content types with good quality
- 25 points: All 7 content types represented with strong quality, local specificity, and regular publishing

---

### 12.3 Content Gap Analysis vs. Competitors (15 points)

**Why This Matters**: Your competitors' content reveals what Google is already rewarding in your market. If the top 3 competitors all have deep blog content and area guides, your thin site will not outrank them on content signals alone.

#### Audit Steps

1. Inventory the top 3 competitors' content:
   - Total pages indexed (`site:competitor.com`)
   - Blog post count and frequency
   - Service page depth (word count, uniqueness)
   - Area guides presence
   - Case studies presence
   - FAQ content
2. Identify topics competitors cover that you do not
3. Identify topics you cover that competitors do not (competitive advantages)
4. Map competitor content to target keywords — which competitor pages rank for your target keywords?
5. Assess competitor content quality — depth, freshness, local specificity

**Scoring**:
- 0 points: Competitor content not analyzed
- 5 points: Basic competitor content inventory completed
- 10 points: Full gap analysis with specific content opportunities identified
- 15 points: Comprehensive gap analysis with topic-by-topic comparison, keyword mapping, and prioritized opportunity list

---

### 12.4 AI Citation Content (15 points)

**Why This Matters**: AI search engines do not just rank pages — they CITE them. When a user asks ChatGPT or Perplexity "Who is the best plumber in Dallas?", the AI engine looks for content it can extract and reference. Content that AI engines cite has specific characteristics.

#### Content That AI Engines Cite

| Content Type | Why AI Cites It | Example |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Local Code Guides** | Factual, authoritative, location-specific | "Dallas Plumbing Code Requirements: A Complete Guide for Homeowners" |
| **Industry Data/Statistics** | Unique data points AI cannot find elsewhere | "2025 Dallas HVAC Repair Cost Survey: Average Costs by System Type" |
| **Comprehensive Resource Pages** | Broad topic coverage in a single source | "The Complete Guide to Home Plumbing in North Texas" |
| **"How Much Does X Cost in [City]" Pages** | Direct answer to common AI queries | "How Much Does a Roof Replacement Cost in Houston, TX?" |
| **Local Regulation Guides** | Specific, accurate, hard-to-find information | "Understanding Fort Worth Building Permits for Home Renovations" |
| **Comparison Content** | Helps AI make recommendations | "Water Softener vs. Water Conditioner: Which Is Best for Dallas Water?" |

#### AI-Ready Content Checklist

- [ ] Contains unique local data or statistics (not generic industry averages)
- [ ] Includes specific pricing for the local market
- [ ] References local regulations, codes, or conditions
- [ ] Structured with clear H2/H3 headings (AI engines parse heading structure)
- [ ] Includes tables and lists (AI engines extract structured data easily)
- [ ] Has a clear, authoritative tone with cited sources
- [ ] Author has visible credentials on the page
- [ ] Content is comprehensive enough to be the "best single source" on the topic
- [ ] Updated with current year data (AI engines check freshness)

**Scoring**:
- 0 points: No content designed for AI citation
- 5 points: 1-2 pieces of content with AI citation characteristics
- 10 points: 3-5 pieces of content designed for AI citation, covering major service topics
- 15 points: Comprehensive AI citation content strategy with local data, guides, and comparison content across all major topics

---

### 12.5 Content Calendar — 90-Day Plan (25 points)
