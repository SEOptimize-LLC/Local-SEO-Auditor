# GBP Categories Reference — Home Services

## How Categories Work (2026)

Primary category acts as a **strict filter** — it determines which queries your listing can appear for. Secondary categories expand relevance to additional query types.

**Rules:**
- Select the MOST SPECIFIC primary category that matches your core service
- Add 5-10 secondary categories for service breadth
- Don't add irrelevant categories — dilutes signals
- Categories are selected from Google's predefined list (you cannot create custom categories)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Using "General Contractor" for a plumber | Too broad — won't trigger plumbing queries | Use "Plumber" |
| Using "Home Services" for HVAC | Too broad — won't trigger HVAC queries | Use "HVAC Contractor" |
| Adding "Real Estate Agent" to a plumber | Irrelevant — dilutes signals | Remove it |
| Having no secondary categories | Missing query opportunities | Add 5-10 relevant ones |
| Adding 15+ categories | Over-optimization, dilutes signals | Keep to 5-10 most relevant |
