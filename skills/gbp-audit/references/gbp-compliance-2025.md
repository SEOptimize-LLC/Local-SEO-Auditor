# GBP Business Name Compliance — August 2025 Enforcement

## Rule
Google Business Profile names must reflect the **real-world, legal name** of your business. Adding keywords, locations, or service descriptions to your business name is a policy violation.

## Enforcement Timeline
- **Pre-2025:** Loosely enforced, many businesses added keywords without penalty
- **August 2025:** Google began active enforcement with automated detection and manual review
- **2026:** Continued enforcement with AI-based detection of keyword-stuffed names

## Compliant Examples

| Compliant | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| ABC Plumbing | Legal business name only |
| ABC Plumbing Inc. | Includes legal suffix |
| ABC Plumbing Co. | Includes legal suffix |
| Specialized Plumbing | Legal name happens to be descriptive — that's fine |

## Non-Compliant Examples (VIOLATIONS)

| Violation | Fix |
|-----------|-----|
| ABC Plumbing - Drain Cleaning, Repair, Service | → ABC Plumbing |
| Emergency Plumber Denver | → [Legal business name] |
| ABC Plumbing \| 24/7 Emergency Service | → ABC Plumbing |
| ABC Plumbing (Licensed & Insured) | → ABC Plumbing |
| ABC Plumbing - Serving Denver Metro | → ABC Plumbing |

## Penalties for Violations
- **Listing suspension:** Google may suspend the listing entirely
- **Ranking demotion:** Even if not suspended, keyword-stuffed names may be demoted
- **Competitor reporting:** Competitors can report violations via the "Suggest an edit" feature
- **Loss of trust:** Google may flag the listing for manual review, delaying other updates

## How to Audit
1. Search your business name in Google Maps
2. Check if the displayed name includes anything beyond the legal business name
3. Compare the GBP name to: signage, legal documents, website copyright, invoices
4. If keywords are present after the business name, remove them immediately

## Edge Cases
- **DBA names:** If you legally operate under a DBA that includes descriptive terms (e.g., "Denver Emergency Plumbing LLC"), this IS compliant — but you need documentation
- **Franchise names:** Use the franchise-approved name format
- **Multi-location with location identifiers:** "ABC Plumbing - Downtown" is acceptable if you have multiple locations and this differentiates them
